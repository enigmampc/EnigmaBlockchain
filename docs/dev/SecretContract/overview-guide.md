# Secret Contract Dev Guide

This repository can be used to get up and running on a local Secret Network developer testnet (secretdev) to start working with CosmWasm-based smart contracts (soon to be Secret Contracts).

A few important notes:

- smart contracts in this repo are a precursor to Secret Contracts, which enable data privacy
- smart contracts are written in Rust and based on CosmWasm, and the module is referred to as `compute` in the Secret Network
- these CosmWasm-based smart contracts should be reusable and easily modified once we incorporate data privacy
