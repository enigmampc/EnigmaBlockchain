// These call out all the way to the Go side. They return `VmError` when something goes wrong in this process.
// These errors need to be propagated back into and out of the enclave, and then bacl into the `cosmwasm-sgx-vm` layer.

// to a type that the enclave can understand, we just box it bedore returning from the enclave, store the heap pointer
// in an instance of `UntrustedVmError`, propagate this error all the way back to the point that called
// into the enclave, and then finally unwrap the `VmError`, which gets propagated up the normal stack.
